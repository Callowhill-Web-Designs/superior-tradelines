You want the best tradeline company? Of course you do. Who wouldn’t? Determining the best tradeline company can be quite subjective. It can be hard to find reliable information. Despite this, we have a very objective criteria and we use it to evaluate tradeline companies, below.

## What kind of tradeline companies are we evaluating?

A lot of companies could be considered tradeline companies. And, we want to be clear about who we’re ranking.

We’re not talking generally about companies who’s stock and trade is credit lines. That could apply to banks and lenders of all kinds. Also, there are companies that write articles with the words “tradelines” in it in order to capture your attention, such as review sites.

That’s not what we’re talking about, here.

We’re talking about **tradeline companies that add authorized user tradelines** onto consumer credit reports for the purpose of improving personal credit scores.

## Traditional criteria for the best tradeline companies.

There are quite a few sites that review tradeline companies. Some of them charge the companies (and potentially give favoritism, such as better ranking, for better compensation). Even so, they do evaluate a lot of areas, such as:

* Informative and useful website.
* Knowledgeable and helpful staff.
* Third-party reviews.
* Inventory.
* Pricing.

That’s great, but we thought of an interesting way to evaluate tradeline companies and how we thought of it is just as interesting.

## Our criteria for the best tradeline companies.

When we realized we were turning 5,000 (5,000 days in business), we thought it was noteworthy. In fact, it’s more than noteworthy; it represents well over a decade of experience in tradelines.

And, then, we realize that is a pretty good criteria by which you can judge tradeline companies: **Days of experience**.

[Experience](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2022/11/15/why-experience-still-matters-in-business/?sh=61a161467171) in business is very important. This is especially true in the complicated world of tradelines.

For that reason, we believe days of experience is a metric that is both easy to understand and provides meaningful insight into a company’s skill and ability.

So, let’s rank ’em…

### The rankings:
