## How much do tradelines for sale cost?

Tradelines for sale range in price.

Some companies claim to offer tradelines in the low hundreds or on a low monthly installment plan. Some companies offer them for sale for over $2,000.00 each. Tradelines under $200.00 are not really realistic as the cardholders usually get paid about this much.

So, unless they are engaging in charity, this is an unrealistic price.

Those offering tradelines for sale for over $2,000.00 are living in the old days… the “old days” being before the FICO ’08 debacle.

**Today, tradelines are realistically priced between $600.00 and $1,500.00. The former will get you a $5,000.00 tradeline and the latter will get you a pretty substantial line, probably over $40,000.00.**

There are deals on tradelines and these deals are usually based upon bulk orders or simplicity of use.

## Tradelines for sale, in general.

**Tradelines are accounts onto which you can pay to be added as an authorized user for the purpose of increasing your credit score. Yes, you can buy seasoned tradelines for credit enhancement. Although buying tradelines can be a powerful tool, you should educate yourself and be careful.**

This page consolidates every bit of information we have on the topic of credit tradelines. It is long, but if you read it, you will know everything you need to know before purchasing authorized user tradelines.

Here’s a quick video to explain buying tradelines, generally.

## The 411 on buying tradelines.

We wrote over 3,000 words on buying [tradelines](https://superiortradelines.com/tradelines/), in general, which you should read. This page, of course, is about purchasing tradelines in order to have an improved credit score.

It might be helpful to explain what tradelines are in a few sentences.

* Tradelines are accounts in your credit report. If you have good accounts (i.e, “tradelines”), you’ll have a good credit score.
* Obviously, the opposite applies. That is, if you have bad accounts in your credit report, you’ll have a bad credit score.

## **How to purchase tradelines for sale.**

In order to get accounts, you have to apply for a credit account and be approved for credit. For example, applying for and being approved for a credit card. Once that credit card shows up on your credit report, that’s a tradeline.

If you have a perfect payment history, your credit score will increase as your credit behavior is proven. If you miss payments or max out the credit account, your credit score will go down.

This takes time, which most of us do not have.

Thankfully, there’s a shortcut.

Parents can add their children as authorized users on to their credit cards. The children benefit from this because the established history of the credit card appears on the child’s credit report. This in turn shows the full credit history of the credit accounts.

As a result, the child’s credit scores shoot through the roof (as if the child had opened and established a credit account with a positive payment history).

This is called piggybacking.

## Now, here’s the trick.

1. 1. It makes no difference whether the parent adds his or her child or a perfect stranger. That father or mother with the credit card can add anyone they want onto their credit card account as an authorized user.
   2. You can pay to be added as an authorized user on someone else’s aged (or “seasoned”) account (or you can “purchase seasoned tradelines.”)

### Commercialization of tradelines for sale.

Although the process is outlined above, there are some gaps in the story.

For example, how…

* Do you find people with a positive payment history on their credit file to add you as an authorized user onto their credit card?
* Does the cardholder find authorized users to add?
* Is this process commercialized so as to protect the parties involved through a broker?

In other words, how is this process put together so that anyone (not just the son or daughter of a wealthy person) can benefit from such an arrangement? Well, the practice of piggybacking credit has become as common as [credit repair](https://superiortradelines.com/credit-repair/).

There are authorized user tradeline companies who organize and connect the cardholders and the consumers seeking to improve their credit scores through this method.

Let’s back up just a bit. Let’s put this in context with a quick note on the history of buying and selling tradelines for credit.

## A quick history.

The practice of piggybacking credit has existed since 1974-ish. It is made possible by a law that was signed into law that year called the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974.

> “The Federal Reserve’s Regulation B, which implements the 1974 Equal Credit Opportunity Act, requires that information on spousal authorized user accounts be reported to the credit bureaus and considered when lenders evaluate credit history. Since creditors generally furnish to the credit bureaus information on all authorized user accounts, without indicating which are spouses and which are not, credit scoring modelers cannot distinguish spousal from non‐spousal authorized user accounts.
>
> This effectively requires that all authorized user accounts receive similar treatment. Consequently, becoming an authorized user on an old account with a good payment history, may improve an individual’s credit score, potentially increasing access to credit or reducing borrowing costs. As a result, the practice of “piggybacking credit” has developed.”

## Tradelines for sale… these days.

Today, the authorized user tradeline industry is growing at a rapid rate. This is a good and bad thing.

It’s good because the benefit of adding tradelines can reach more consumers as they become more aware of the options available to them.

It’s bad because shoddy “businesses” are popping up left and right trying to clone that which has been established by legitimate tradeline companies.

As a result, the quality of service has been compromised.

If you google authorized user tradelines, you’ll see many pages of results of people offering tradelines for sale.

Go to YouTube, you’ll see everything from [professional tradeline videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/superiortradelinesllc?sub_confirmation=1) to people walking around an apartment complex in their pajamas “teaching” others how to increase their credit scores.

If you go on Craigslist (which you should never do), you’ll see packages from a no-name, no-company, no-phone-number “seller” asking you to irrevocably wire money in exchange for tradeline services.

In a market this ripe for abuse, you must be careful!

### Buying authorized user tradelines for sale.

Here’s what it’s like to buy tradelines. You need to be very careful when you decide on a company. This is what a tradeline buying experience should be like:

### **1) You should research and find a professional tradelines company.**

You should look for their brand. Be sure that their website has a lot of content. Look for their faces on the site. Look for direct contact information.

Once you have a level of comfort, you should call them (don’t let them hide behind emails… get on the phone so you can use your judgment and evaluate their worthiness for your business).

### **2) The tradelines company should offer to review your credit goals and your credit report.**

Why? Because without reviewing your credit history, how else would they know which tradelines you need? If a company is offering you a list, that’s like a doctor saying “just pick some medicine and pay the clerk on the way out.” Or, it’s like a mechanic shoving a parts catalog in your face rather than asking you what’s wrong with your car.

### **3) The tradelines company should make an informed recommendation designed to help you, not their pocketbook.**

This recommendation should include which tradelines, how many, credit limit, ages, etc. Or, if you’re not qualified for tradelines, they should make a recommendation for some other credit-related service (rather than sell you tradelines that won’t work).

![](/assets/images/blog/tradelines-for-sale-recommendation-1024x592.jpg)

### **4) The tradelines company should put their promises in a written agreement.**

Not only should they do this, but it’s [required by law](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter41-subchapterII-A&num=0&edition=prelim). You will get an agreement that outlines the service, price, refund policy, etc. In addition, you’ll receive a rights statement under federal and state law. Also, you’ll get a notice of cancellation (showing you how to cancel, should you decide to cancel).

### **5) The company should hold your funds in trust (like “escrow”).**

This service is to protect you in the event things don’t go as planned. In fact, if a company establishes a trust account and surety bond, that’s *almost* enough to trust them, because then they can get in serious trouble if they try to rip you off.

### **6) Tradelines for sale don’t always go as planned.**

If for some reason the tradelines don’t report, a good company will either offer a refund or try the services again at no additional cost.

## Tradeline Deals vs. Tradeline Scams.

Just as you should be cautious with the company with which you do business, you should be cautious for so-called tradeline “deals” and unrealistically low prices.

We recently wrote an article showing [what happens when you buy $300.00 tradelines](https://superiortradelines.com/scenarios/heres-what-happens-when-you-buy-300-00-tradelines/). We started with fake and misleading ads on Google, like this:

![](/assets/images/blog/150-to-300-for-tradelines-1024x314.jpg)

The article goes on to show the bait and switch as well as the resulting complaint against the company.

We say:

> “Cheap doesn’t mean scam, but too cheap does.”

##### If that’s the case, how do you find legitimate deals?

Well, you should first understand a bit of the economics that goes into buying tradelines. When you do, you’ll be able to spot nonsense from a mile away.

First of all, to run a legitimate business, you’ll need:

* Legal expenses (establishing, maintaining, etc.)
* Accounting (filing taxes, etc.)
* An office (rent)
* Knowledge (which takes time to acquire)
* Marketing (to attract customers and vendors)
* A website (which is expensive, if it’s dynamic)
* Labor (you’ll need to pay everyone involved)

One of those people being paid is a cardholder (the person adding the clients).

They typically get paid no less than $100.00 per authorized user. $150.00 is very common. $200.00 to $300.00 is common for higher end cards.

So, right off the bat, it’s literally impossible to sell tradelines for $100.00 (or $200.00 or $300.00).

Now, you can cut out a lot of that stuff above, but you will be cutting out value. The more you cut, the more you demand less legitimacy from the tradeline company.

When people offer very low prices, they’re literally saying “I don’t do everything I should in exchange for charging you less.”

Most of the time, it’s because they have no intention of doing anything at all and you’ll likely part with $150.00 on the mere promise of service, despite no recourse, whatsoever.

## Legitimate tradeline deals.

There are only a few situations in which [tradeline deals](https://superiortradelines.com/specials/) are legitimate.

1. The tradeline company has an oversupply of inventory and decides to take a cut from their fee which they will make up with the volume of sales resulting from the deal.
2. Vendors whose lines remain unsold may agree to reduce their fee, savings which can be passed on to the consumer.
3. A salesperson agrees to reduce their fee to receive a bonus based on total sales or some other kind of promotional benefit (such as a tradeline giveaway for promotional purposes).

So, to do things correctly, it’s going to cost a certain amount of money (which is way more than $300.00).

In order to offer a deal, someone at some point must be willing to forgo a portion of the fee they’re otherwise entitled to. Possibly, in exchange for some other value (i.e., more overall sales, promotion, bonus, etc.).

# **TRADELINES YOU CAN’T BUY:**

**Primary tradelines.** No, you cannot buy primary tradelines. The only reason you can buy authorized user tradelines is that there is a law which says lenders shall consider them. As discussed above, this is how the practice of piggybacking credit was commercialized. There is no similar law for primary tradelines; you cannot pay to be added to a primary account and backdate history like you can with seasoned authorized user tradelines.

**Mortgage.** A mortgage tradeline is only a primary tradeline. There’s no such thing as an authorized user on a mortgage tradeline. Also, even if there was (which there isn’t), you would kill your purchasing power and hurt your chances of securing credit in the future.

**Auto.** As far as buying primary tradelines is concerned, the same thing written about mortgages (above) applies (here). You can’t buy them; it’s just not legal. Also, you’d shackle your credit report with debt hurting you credit (not helping it).

**Tradelines for business credit.** Business credit accounts function on a completely different credit report (Dun & Bradstreet) and credit score (Paydex). Of the very few business lines of credit accept authorized users, they only report to the primary account holder’s credit report.

## Tradelines for Sale Conclusion:

Authorized user tradelines provide the opportunity to increase your credit score by being added to positive account (or “tradelines”) as an authorized user.
