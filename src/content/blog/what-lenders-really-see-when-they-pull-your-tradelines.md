---
When you apply for credit, lenders don’t just look at your credit score—they take a much deeper dive. The tradelines listed on your credit report reveal far more than most people realize. Lenders analyze the age, balance, utilization, payment history, and even the type of credit accounts to assess your creditworthiness.

In this post, we’ll walk you through how lenders actually evaluate your tradelines—and how smart use of authorized-user accounts can give you the upper hand.

### **What Are Lenders Looking For?**

When reviewing tradelines, lenders are asking:

* **How long has this person managed credit?**
* **Do they use credit responsibly?**
* **Have they missed payments?**
* **Is there a mix of credit types?**
* **Is this behavior consistent across all accounts?**

This deeper analysis is why two people with the same credit score might get very different loan offers.

### **Key Tradeline Metrics**

1. **Age of Accounts:** Lenders prefer applicants with older accounts. The average age of your accounts plays a big role in FICO scoring.
2. **Credit Utilization:** High utilization is a red flag. Lenders like to see under 30%, but under 10% is ideal.
3. **Payment History:** Missed or late payments signal risk. One late payment can tank your score and lender confidence.
4. **Credit Mix:** A combination of revolving (credit cards) and installment (loans) accounts is best.
5. **Recent Activity:** Opening too many new accounts recently can be viewed as risky behavior.

### **How AU Tradelines Help Shape the Picture**

Adding a high-quality AU tradeline can:

* Increase your average account age
* Lower your credit utilization
* Show a pattern of consistent on-time payments

All of these positively influence a lender’s impression. In fact, many mortgage underwriters weigh the details of tradelines heavily in their approval decisions. You can read more about this in our post on Preparing Your Credit for a Mortgage.

### **Lender Profiles: What They Prioritize**

* **Mortgage Lenders:** Focus on payment history, utilization, and account age.
* **Auto Lenders:** Slightly more lenient but still review overall usage patterns.
* **Credit Card Issuers:** Often place more weight on recent activity and utilization.

### **Final Thoughts**

Understanding what lenders actually look for helps you shape your profile with purpose. By strategically adding tradelines that demonstrate responsible behavior, you’re more likely to get the approval—and the interest rate—you want.
