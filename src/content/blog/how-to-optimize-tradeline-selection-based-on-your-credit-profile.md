Not all tradelines are created equal. If you're considering using authorized-user (AU) tradelines to boost your credit, it's critical to choose ones that match your individual credit situation. In this post, we'll explain how to select the right tradelines for your needs—and how the wrong ones can have minimal (or even negative) results.

### **Why One-Size-Fits-All Doesn’t Work**

Your credit profile is unique, and tradeline impact depends heavily on context. For example:

* A thin credit file might benefit most from older tradelines with low utilization.
* Someone with recent derogatory marks might need tradelines with perfect payment history to dilute negative items.
* A person with several young accounts might prioritize tradelines with long age to strengthen average account age.

### **Case Scenarios**

**Thin Credit File:** If you have fewer than 3 accounts on your report, you're considered to have a "thin file." Look for tradelines that are over 3 years old, have high limits, and low balances to help demonstrate creditworthiness.

**Recent Late Payments:** Tradelines won’t erase lates, but adding accounts with perfect histories can help your positive-to-negative ratio. Choose accounts that have never missed a payment.

**Building Toward a Mortgage:** Age, low utilization, and type of account matter most here. Revolving tradelines (like credit cards) that are 5+ years old and under 10% utilization tend to yield the best results.

### **Key Factors in Selection**

* **Age of Tradeline:** Older is better. 2+ years minimum, but 5+ years is ideal.
* **Credit Limit:** Higher limits show lenders you can handle large amounts responsibly.
* **Utilization:** Keep it below 10%. This helps your overall credit utilization ratio.
* **Payment History:** Must be spotless. One late payment negates all the benefits.

### **Example Outcomes**

A user with a 580 credit score and a 2-account file added two 10-year tradelines with $20,000 limits. Within 45 days, their score jumped 70 points. Another user with 5 collections and a similar score saw only a 10-point increase—because derogatory items dominated the report.

### **The Bottom Line**

Matching tradelines to your unique profile is a must. If you're unsure, reach out to us for a free tradeline consultation or read our [Tradeline Strategy Guide](https://tradelinesuperior.com/tradelines/) for more.
