Like a fingerprint or DNA, no credit report is the same. As such, the impact of tradeline on credit score is entirely dependent on what is on the credit report.

Unfortunately, the “40 to 50 points per tradeline” claims you see on competitor websites are so false and misleading. They could be considered humorous (if only these claims didn’t negatively affect real people’s lives).

[Piggybacking credit tradelines](https://superiortradelines.com/faqs/piggybacking-credit/) affects everyone differently because everyone’s starting point is different.




## Can you tell me, generally, how much my score will increase by adding Seasoned Tradelines?

 

Generally, the fewer the number of [tradelines](https://superiortradelines.com/) (or accounts) you already have on your credit report, the larger impact the authorized user tradelines will have on your credit score. Likewise, the inverse is also true.

Largely, the fewer negative items you have on your credit report, the higher your score will increase after adding [seasoned tradelines](https://superiortradelines.com/faqs/seasoned-tradelines/). Again, the opposite applies.

We will discuss three scenarios…

1. What credit score increase to expect with negative items such as collections and charge-offs
2. What happens if you try to pack your credit report with too many seasoned tradelines
3. The benefits of adding tradelines to a thin credit file.

### Tradeline’s impact on the score when added to a report with derogatory items…

Of course, all situations are different. However, it is possible to boost your score with tradelines even if you have negative items on your current credit report.

Again, the amount and severity of the negative items will determine how much of a boost you get. Furthermore, the appropriate selection of tradelines can help to counter the problems with your report. 


### Can I just load up my credit report with Tradelines and get an 800 credit score?

We’ve run into a couple of situations where clients demand that we sell them 5 and 6 tradelines.

Unfortunately, we decline each request as it simply will not work. Additionally, we like to help our clients, not hurt them. If you exceed a certain amount of authorized user tradelines, it seems to freeze any movement in your score. Unfortunately, we are not sure why this happens.



## Seasoned Tradelines Study

Recently, we conducted a [study of the benefits of tradelines](https://superiortradelines.com/tradelines-for-credit-study/) for over 850 participants. The study found that the average credit score increase across all 850 participants was roughly 88 points.

Does this mean that you will experience such a large boost if you add seasoned tradelines? No.
As stated above, the benefit of the tradeline will depend heavily upon what is already on your credit report.

If you are interested in getting tradelines, we highly recommend that you read this study. It could guide you on whether tradelines will be a good fit for you!
