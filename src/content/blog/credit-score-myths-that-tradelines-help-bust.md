Your credit score can feel like a black box—full of numbers, rules, and advice that never quite adds up. With all the misinformation out there, it’s easy to fall into traps that end up hurting more than helping.

At **Superior Tradelines**, we’ve worked with people at every stage of the credit journey. One thing we see again and again? Smart people getting tripped up by common credit myths. The good news is; the right tradeline strategy can clear up the confusion—and help you move forward with real, measurable progress.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the most persistent credit score myths—and how tradelines help set the record straight.





### **Myth #1: You Need a Perfect Credit Score to Get Approved**

Many people think you need an 800+ score to qualify for a loan, get a mortgage, or be taken seriously by lenders.

**Reality:** You don’t need perfection—you need a strong, consistent profile. Scores in the 600s and low 700s are often enough to qualify, especially if the rest of your credit report shows responsible behavior.

**How tradelines help:** A well-aged, low-utilization tradeline can lift your score and make your file look more solid. We've seen clients go from the high 500s to mortgage-ready ranges in under two months—without gimmicks or shortcuts.





### **Myth #2: Closing Old Accounts Helps Your Score**

Some people think shutting down old credit cards shows they’re being responsible. In most cases, it does the opposite.

**Reality:** Closing an old account can shorten your credit history and raise your utilization ratio—both of which drag your score down.

**How tradelines help:** Our tradelines come with long-standing account history and low balances. Adding one can improve your average account age and overall profile stability without the risks of closing anything.





### **Myth #3: All Debt, No Matter What Kind, Is Bad for Your Credit**

A zero-debt lifestyle might sound ideal, but when it comes to your credit score, it’s not doing you any favors.

**Reality:** Lenders want to see how you manage your credit, not that you avoid it altogether. Responsible use of revolving credit is important when building a strong credit profile.

**How tradelines help:** Authorized user tradelines (AUs) show positive credit activity without requiring you to take on new or additional debt. You get to benefit from an account’s history, age, and utilization without the negative impact of opening a new account.





### **Myth #4: A Few Points Don’t Matter**

Think there's no difference between a 679 and a 680? Or a 699 and 700? Think again.

**Reality:** Credit scores are grouped into brackets, and crossing into a higher one can mean better interest rates, better terms, and more approvals.

**How tradelines help:** Even one tradeline can be the tipping point that moves your score into a new bracket. That could be the difference between a 6.5% mortgage rate and a 5.5% one, saving thousands over the life of the loan.





### **Myth #5: Utilization Doesn’t Matter If You Pay in Full**

A lot of people pay their balances in full each month and assume they’re in the clear. But the timing matters.

**Reality:** Your utilization is based on the balance reported on your statement date, not your due date. So, even if you pay in full later, a high balance on that statement can still hurt your score.

**How tradelines help:** A tradeline with a high limit and low balance can improve your utilization right away. With just one tradeline, you can potentially raise your score by 20–50 points, depending on your credit history and profile.





### **Myth #6: Tradelines Are a Scam or Shortcut**

Some folks are hesitant about tradelines because they’ve heard they’re shady or some sort of credit loophole.

**Reality:** Authorized user tradelines are a legal, well-established method of building credit. Banks encourage parents to add their kids as AUs to help them get started—it’s the same idea.

**Why Superior Tradelines is different:** We operate with strict compliance. No hype, no pressure. We match you with tradelines that make sense for your goals—and we never sell something we wouldn’t use ourselves.





### **Myth #7: Tradelines Only Help People with Bad Credit**

Tradelines aren’t just for fixing damaged credit. They’re for anyone looking to improve, build, or optimize their profile.

**Reality:** Whether you're starting from scratch, preparing for a big loan, or just trying to break through a plateau, tradelines can be a smart addition.

**Who we help:** First-time homebuyers, entrepreneurs, students building credit for the first time—even people in the 700s who want better terms on financing.





### **Myth #8: All Tradeline Companies Are the Same**

A lot of people assume tradeline companies all pull from the same accounts and offer the same service. That’s far from true.

**Reality:** Many companies are brokers who mark up accounts they don’t control. They’ll promise big results, then disappear after the sale.
